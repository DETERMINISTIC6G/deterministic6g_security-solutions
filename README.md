# Security Solution for Deterministic Applications on 6G Networks

This page contains source code of components in the Montimage's security solutions for Deterministic6G research [project](https://deterministic6g.eu/).

# Objective: Security by design
- Real-time traffic monitoring
- Real-time analysis and reasoning
- Remediation mechanism

# Architecture

- Local & End-to-End Security Management Domains
- Realtime ZSM closed-loop: monitoring – detection – reaction
